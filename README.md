# Indent/java.vim

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xuhdev/indent-java.vim.png)](https://travis-ci.org/xuhdev/indent-java.vim)

This is the [Vim][] indent script for [Java][]. You could also find this script
at [Vim Online][].

This script has been included in the official Vim distribution since Vim
version 7.3.409.

To install, simply drop `indent/java.vim` to your Vim `runtimepath`, which is
usually `~/.vim` in UNIX-like systems and `$VIM_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\vimfiles`
in Windows.

The tests are built upon [rspec][]. To run the test, first please have [Ruby][]
and [bundler][] installed. Then run `bundle` to install all the files needed
for testing. Finally run `bundle exec rake` to run the test.
